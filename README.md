## Features

- Users can sign up and login.
- Once they click the sign up button, the application runs a scraping process and acquires headings(h1-h3) from the given user's website.
- These headings are then stored in the user's headings column.
- Another process that runs is the Bitly url shortening process and the shortened URL is saved in the database as well.
- Users can find experts using a search feature which looks through the headings to find experts in topics of their liking.
- The results show the expert and if there are mutual friends with the found expert they can see a list of them there as well.
